                                <td>What can I expect from my first appointment?<br><br>The assessment is always our
                                    first step and arguably one of the most important parts of the whole process for
                                    you to regain a pain-free life and continue enjoying your favourite sports and
                                    activities. We will talk through your symptoms and past medical history before
                                    completing a thorough hands-on
                                    assessment to examine aspects like your range of motion, strength and functional
                                    biomechanics.<br><br> The
                                    knowledge we have gained from our degrees and post graduate qualifications form the
                                    scientific foundations
                                    but there is much more involved in the treatment and rehabilitation process so we
                                    will always ensure you
                                    are involved with the decision making once a working diagnosis has been made.

                                    No two injuries are the same and your life commitments, time restrictions, and
                                    motivations play as big a part as anything!
                                    There is much you can do beyond your appointments, and this is an area we are eager
                                    to address to prevent
                                    your symptoms
                                    from recurring after receiving a temporary quick fix.

                                    we will ask to see the area in question and so this may require you to
                                    remove outer clothing. If you feel more comfortable in shorts and a vest top, for
                                    example, please bring
                                    these along. We have changing facilities on site. If you are a runner, it is often
                                    useful for us to see
